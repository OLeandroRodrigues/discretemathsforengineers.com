# Discrete Maths for Engineers

**Discrete Maths for Engineers** is a static website dedicated to discrete mathematics concepts that are fundamental for software engineers and computer scientists.

The goal of this project is to present discrete mathematics in a clear, structured, and practical way, connecting formal theory with real-world engineering and computing problems.

- Sets, relations, and functions  
- Proof techniques (induction, contradiction, invariants)  
- Graph theory and trees  
- Combinatorics and counting principles  
- Discrete structures applied to algorithms and systems

🚀 Running Locally
You can run the site locally by simply opening index.html in your browser.

Optionally, you can use a simple static server:

npx serve src
✍️ Publishing Content
New articles are added as standalone HTML files under the posts/ directory.

Each post follows a simple structure and can be linked directly from the homepage or topic pages.

📌 Motivation
Discrete mathematics is often seen as abstract or disconnected from practice.
This project aims to bridge that gap by presenting concepts with intuition, rigor, and practical relevance for engineers.
