              <h3>Vertex</h3>

              <p class="math-note">
                A <strong>vertex</strong> is one of the fundamental elements of a graph.
                Formally, a vertex is an element of the set
                <span class="math">\(V\)</span>.
              </p>

              <p class="math-note">
                Intuitively, vertices represent the <em>objects</em> of the problem modeled
                by the graph, such as cities, users, states, or points.
              </p>

              <p class="math-note">
                The set of vertices is usually denoted by
                <span class="math">\(V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}\)</span>,
                where <span class="math">\(|V| = n\)</span>.

              <h3>Edge</h3>

              <p class="math-note">
                An <strong>edge</strong> is a <strong>directed</strong> connection between two vertices.
                Formally, an edge is an ordered pair
                <span class="math">\((u, v)\)</span>, with
                <span class="math">\(u, v \in V\)</span>.
              </p>

              <p class="math-note">
                The edge <span class="math">\((u, v)\)</span> indicates that there is a connection
                that starts at vertex <strong>u</strong> and ends at vertex <strong>v</strong>.
              </p>

              <p class="math-note">
                The set of edge is denoted by
                <span class="math">\(A \subseteq V \times V\)</span>,
                and the number of edges is given by <span class="math">\(|A| = m\)</span>.

              <h3>Important note</h3>

              <p class="math-note">
                In <strong>undirected graphs</strong>, connections have no direction and are
                called <strong>edges</strong>, being represented by
                <strong>unordered</strong> pairs of vertices.
              </p>

              <p class="math-note">
                In <strong>directed graphs</strong>, the term
                <strong>arc</strong> is used, emphasizing the existence of direction.
