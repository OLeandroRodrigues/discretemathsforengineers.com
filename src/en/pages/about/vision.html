              Discrete Maths for Engineers is an educational project dedicated to helping
              students and professionals build strong foundations in discrete mathematics.

              Our goal is to make fundamental concepts clear, structured, and connected
              to real computational problems, bringing all content together in a single
              logically organized environment with intuitive navigation, allowing learning
              to happen progressively, consistently, and in a practice-oriented way.
            </div>

            <ul class="math-list" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <li><strong>Structured content</strong>: from basic to advanced, in a logical sequence.</li>
              <li><strong>Rigor and clarity</strong>: formal definitions, visual examples, and mathematical intuition.</li>
              <li><strong>Connection to computing</strong>: direct application to algorithms and engineering.</li>
              <li><strong>Intuitive navigation</strong>: organized, progressive, and integrated series.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
              New content is published regularly, with a focus on clarity,
              consistency, and long-term learning.
