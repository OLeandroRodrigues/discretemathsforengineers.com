          <h3>About the project</h3>

          <p>
            Discrete Maths for Engineers is an educational project for engineers, software developers,
            and computer scientists who want to understand and apply discrete mathematics to real-world problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal is not abstract theory for its own sake, but strong intuition, precise definitions,
            and practical reasoning tools that traditional continuous mathematics often does not address.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project is developed with care, rigor, and long-term vision, aiming to bridge the gap
            between mathematical foundations and real engineering challenges.
